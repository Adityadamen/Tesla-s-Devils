What is PCOS?

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a hormonal disorder common among women of reproductive age. Women with PCOS may have infrequent or prolonged menstrual periods or excess male hormone (androgen) levels. The ovaries may develop numerous small collections of fluid (follicles) and fail to regularly release eggs.

The exact cause of PCOS is unknown. Early diagnosis and treatment along with weight loss may reduce the risk of long-term complications such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease.
Importance of generating awareness 

An estimated one in five (20%) Indian women suffer from PCOS, and a majority of them aren’t aware about this fact. If not monitored in time, the condition can have serious health impacts. PCOS is not a disease, but a condition that can present itself in different ways.

Women with PCOS are at a high risk of developing diabetes, high blood pressure, and other health complications. Experts say most women ignore the common symptoms of PCOS and turn to a doctor only when they face trouble conceiving. The incidence of the condition has been increasing every year, yet many women don’t think that it may be PCOS even when they notice symptoms. 

Aim of this project

Aim of this project is generating awareness about this prevalent disease. Our ML based model predicts the probability of a person having PCOS on basis of few simple questions. PCOS is not a disease, it’s a lifelong condition whose repercussions can be mitigated through certain healthy changes in lifestyle, early detection and seeking help from a professional.
